For this project, I don't really have any part on the coding or the design part. Mostly for this project I had to mentor a Grade 11 group teach them Godot for their project. I teach them how to work with Godot, studying GDScript, Modularity, Version Control using Git and 
a bit of Game Physics. We were able to get 2nd Place for our efforts and I am very proud of them.
