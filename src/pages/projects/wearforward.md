This was my first major project outside of iAcademy. This was almost a two year project and I was so stressed. So I first interned in this start-up named Wear Forward, a sustainable fashion start up that specializes in upcycling second hand clothes and those that are no long wearable. They upcycle this material in order to create new products for their store. I had to be the project manager for the whole thing and also being the full stack developer. I worked with multiple people during this project. At first, as I was just interning, we had 2 weeks to create the website. Next I signed up as a part timer two work on it. It was quite stressful and I really had a hard time managing everything. I was managing the client, server, uml, ERD and also the CMS. We used Next.js and Strapi for CMS
