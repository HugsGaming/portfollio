This was my first major project when I first enrolled in iAcademy back in 2019. This was quite the experience, it was my first time being a project manager. I didn't know much about Source Control so me and my groupmates didn't use Git or GitHub so we had to rely on zip files a lot if one of us did any changes to one program. I did a majority of the backend and while my teamates went for the design of the game like Level Design and characters. We reached top 8 and it was a great experience albeit quite stressful. I learned a lot about project management and working as a team. The Game Engine we use is the Godot Engine.
